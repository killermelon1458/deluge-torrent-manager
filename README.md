# Deluge Torrent Manager Setup (Virtualenv + VPN + Automation)

This project documents the full setup of a **headless, secure, Deluge torrent box** running on a Linux server (e.g., Raspberry Pi), using:

* ✅ Deluge Daemon in a Python `virtualenv`
* 🔐 VPN via `tun0` interface (e.g., Surfshark OpenVPN)
* 🔁 Systemd-based autostart
* ⚙️ Error recovery automation (`deluge_log_errors.py`)
* 📂 Automated torrent management (`deluge_torrent_manager.py`)
* 🔒 UFW firewall with tight VPN-only egress
* 🧠 This README is written to give LLMs and humans full context for future debugging or feature development

## 🖥️ System Overview

**User:** `torbox`
**OS:** Linux (Debian-based)
**Python:** 3.10 (via `virtualenv`)
**VPN:** OpenVPN via `tun0`, static IP from provider
**Deluge version:** Latest from `pip`
**Libtorrent:** v2.0.11.0 (built from source)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo and Create the Virtualenv

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3.10-venv python3-pip build-essential libboost-python-dev libtorrent-rasterbar-dev git

python3.10 -m venv ~/deluge-venv-310
source ~/deluge-venv-310/bin/activate

pip install wheel setuptools deluge deluge-client
```

### 2. Build `libtorrent` from Source (if needed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent
cd libtorrent
python3.10 setup.py build
python3.10 setup.py install
```

Check version:

```bash
python -c "import libtorrent as lt; print('libtorrent version:', lt.version)"
```

### 3. Launch `deluged` in the venv

```bash
source ~/deluge-venv-310/bin/activate
~/.config/systemd/user/deluged.service → points to correct venv path
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now deluged
loginctl enable-linger torbox  # Important for user services
```

### 4. Set up Firewall (UFW)

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default deny outgoing

# Allow VPN and local LAN
sudo ufw allow out on tun0
sudo ufw allow in on tun0
sudo ufw allow out 53,1194/udp  # DNS + VPN
sudo ufw allow out to 192.168.1.0/24  # Local access
sudo ufw allow in from 192.168.1.0/24

# Deluge
sudo ufw allow in 58846/tcp
sudo ufw allow in 8112/tcp
```

## 🔧 Crontab Jobs

```bash
# Run the log monitor and error recovery script every 5 min
*/5 * * * * /home/torbox/deluge-venv-310/bin/python /home/torbox/deluge_project_repo/deluge_log_errors.py >/dev/null 2>&1

# Run the torrent queue manager (flock prevents overlap)
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /home/torbox/.cache/deluge_torrent_manager.lock \
  /home/torbox/deluge-venv-310/bin/python /home/torbox/deluge_project_repo/deluge_torrent_manager.py >/dev/null 2>&1
```

## 📜 Summary of Custom Scripts

### `deluge_log_errors.py`

* Connects to Deluge via `deluge-client`
* Logs any torrents in `Error` state
* Automatically resumes or rechecks based on message content
* Triggers rechecks if resume fails (e.g., for 'bad address' or 'resume data' issues)
* Removes completed torrents based on config

### `deluge_torrent_manager.py`

* Ensures a fixed number of downloads run at once
* Queues or resumes torrents intelligently
* Meant to keep the system operating smoothly and prevent overload

## 🔐 Credentials & Security

* The real Deluge password has been **removed** from public scripts
* Replace `DELUGE_PASS` in your scripts with the actual localclient password from `~/.config/deluge/auth`
* Recommend rotating this password and storing securely if uploading to GitHub

## 🧠 Notes for LLMs & Future Developers

This setup:

* Uses `virtualenv` isolation to avoid system Python issues
* Is intended for headless systems (no GUI)
* Has automated log and torrent state management via Python scripts + cron
* Uses a strict UFW firewall to ensure only VPN traffic is allowed outbound
* Should not leak your real IP — tested using torrent-based IP leak trackers

To diagnose problems:

* Use `systemctl --user status deluged` to check the daemon
* Use `journalctl --user -u deluged` for logs
* Check `~/deluge_logs/` for error logs generated by the Python scripts
* Use `deluge-console` inside the virtualenv for quick torrent inspection
